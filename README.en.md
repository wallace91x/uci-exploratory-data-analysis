# 📊 Data Analysis and Best Practices – UCI Default Credit Card Project

This is a Data Analysis MVP developed by **Wallace Lima** as part of the Data Science MBA at **PUC-Rio**.

The goal of the project is to apply best practices in **exploratory data analysis**, **data visualization**, and **preprocessing**, using a real-world dataset on credit card client defaults.

## 🧠 Project Objective

- Investigate default patterns in credit card clients.
- Perform exploratory analysis using descriptive statistics.
- Apply preprocessing techniques such as missing value handling, categorical encoding, and discretization.
- Present clear and informative visualizations with brief interpretations.

## ℹ️ Important Note

> This project was developed as part of the *Exploratory Data Analysis and Preprocessing* course of the Data Science MBA at PUC-Rio.  
> The scope was **intentionally limited to EDA and preprocessing**, **excluding predictive modeling**, in accordance with academic requirements.  
> Machine learning models will be introduced in later modules of the program.
